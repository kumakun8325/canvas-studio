stderr | src/pages/Editor.test.tsx > Editor > project auto-loading on login > should handle errors when creating new project
An update to Editor inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://react.dev/link/wrap-tests-with-act
