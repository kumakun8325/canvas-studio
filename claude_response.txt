## Summary

I've verified that the basic canvas implementation for Task 02 has been **successfully completed**. All files have been created according to the specification in `docs/task_02.md`:

### Implementation Status

- `src/stores/editorStore.ts` - Created with Zustand store for editor state
- `src/stores/slideStore.ts` - Created with Zustand store for slide management
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Created with Fabric.js canvas operations
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasView.tsx` - Created canvas view component
- `src/components/canvas/Toolbar.tsx` - Created toolbar with tool buttons
- `src/pages/Editor.tsx` - Created editor page integrating components
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated to render Editor component

### Verification Results

All checks passed:
- Build: Success (dist/483.35 kB)
- Lint: No errors
- Type check: No errors

The implementation includes:
- Fabric.js canvas with basic shape tools (rectangle, circle, text)
- Selection and deletion functionality
- State management with Zustand
- Proper TypeScript typing

### Next Steps

To manually test the implementation:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Click toolbar buttons to add shapes
4. Select objects and press Delete to remove them
