The implementation for Task 02 (Basic Canvas Implementation) is complete. Here's a summary of what was verified/fixed:

## Summary

All files for Task 02 were already implemented. I made minor fixes to align with the task specification:

### Files Verified (all matching spec):
- **src/stores/editorStore.ts** - Zustand store for editor state
- **src/stores/slideStore.ts** - Zustand store for slide/project management
- **src/hooks/useCanvas.ts** - Fabric.js canvas hook with shape creation
- **src/components/canvas/CanvasView.tsx** - Canvas view component
- **src/pages/Editor.tsx** - Editor page component
- **src/App.tsx** - Main app component

### Files Fixed:
- **src/components/canvas/Toolbar.tsx** - Changed from props-based callbacks to using `useCanvas` hook directly

### Build Verification:
- Build: PASSED
- Lint: PASSED

The basic canvas functionality is now ready with:
- Rectangle tool (blue rectangle)
- Circle tool (green circle)
- Text tool (editable text)
- Delete key support for removing objects
